MXNet Python Package
====================

`MXNet <http://mxnet.io>`__ is a deep learning framework designed for
both *efficiency* and *flexibility*. It allows you to mix the flavours
of deep learning programs together to maximize the efficiency and your
productivity.

Prerequisites
-------------

This package supports Linux and Mac OSX platforms. If you have GPU and
are using Linux, you may want to check
`mxnet-cu80mkl <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu80mkl/>`__ and
`mxnet-cu80 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu80/>`__ with CUDA-8.0
support, or
`mxnet-cu75mkl <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu75mkl/>`__ and
`mxnet-cu75 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-cu75/>`__ with CUDA-7.5
support. If you are using Linux without GPU, you may want to check
`mxnet-mkl <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mxnet-mkl/>`__ with MKL
support.

To install for other platforms (e.g. Windows) or for general
installation guide, check `Build
Instruction <http://mxnet.io/get_started/setup.html>`__.
